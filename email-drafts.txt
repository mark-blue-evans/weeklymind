Subject: Podcast Guest Inquiry - WeeklyMind App (5-Min Weekly Mental Wellness)

Hi Dr. Joy,

I'd love to be a guest on Therapy for Black Girls to discuss WeeklyMind - a simple, private weekly mental wellness check-in app.

The problem: Most mental health apps are too complex. 66% of workers feel burned out, but existing tools overwhelm users with daily streaks, social features, and constant tracking.

The solution: WeeklyMind has just 3 questions. 5 minutes weekly. 100% private (data stays on device, no tracking, no accounts).

Topics I can speak to:
- Why simplicity matters in mental wellness
- The power of weekly reflection vs. daily pressure
- Privacy-first design for trust
- How weekly check-ins build self-awareness

Happy to work around your format - quick interview or longer discussion.

Would you have 15-20 minutes for a quick call?

Best,
Markus
WeeklyMind Founder

Hi Dr. Delony,

I'm reaching out about being a guest on The Dr. John Delony Show.

WeeklyMind is a simple mental wellness app: 3 questions, 5 minutes weekly, 100% private.

The key insight: The problem isn't lack of tools - it's TOO MANY tools. People are overwhelmed by apps that track everything, demand daily engagement, and feel like work.

WeeklyMind is different:
- No login, no accounts
- All data stays on your device
- Just weekly reflection, no daily streaks
- Free, no premium upsells

I'd love to share this on your show and help your listeners discover a simpler path to mental wellness.

Would you be open to a quick call?

Best,
Markus
WeeklyMind Founder

Hi Dan,

I'm reaching out about being a guest on Ten Percent Happier.

WeeklyMind tackles a gap in mental wellness: simplicity.

The problem: Apps like Calm and Headspace are great, but many users want something even simpler - no subscription, no daily notifications, no gamification.

WeeklyMind:
- 3 questions weekly
- 100% private (local-only data)
- No login required
- Free forever

I've studied the mental wellness space extensively, and there's a real segment of people who want "less is more." I'd love to discuss this on your show.

Would you have time for a brief call?

Best,
